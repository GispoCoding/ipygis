    """Calculates spatial clusters/outliers based on a column in a geofataframe


    Workflow:

    1.  Create a spatial weights matrix
    2.  Create a spatially lagged version of the variable of interest
    3.  Calculate global spatial autocorrelation metrics
    4.  Calculate local spatial autocorrelation (the clusters) using LISA
        (local indicators of spatial autocorrelation)
    5.  Join data to original gdf

    While the code should work for any geodataframe, the current workflow is
    based on the assumption that the data being analyzed is in a hexagonal
    grid. This means we have polygons of approximately uniform weights. The
    https://pysal.org/libpysal/generated/libpysal.weights.Rook.html weighting
    calculates weights between all polygons that share an edge. Note that this
    requires the grid is filled with polygons, i.e. we don't have islands in
    the grid.


    Input:

    gdf     The source geodataframe, should be a hexagonal grid if using this
            script as is
    crs     A coordinate reference system, EPSG code
    col     The column with the data being modeled
    alpha   The threshold of statistical significance to be used when determing
            whether a cell is a cluster/outlier or not. Defaults to 0.05


    The output is the original dataframe with 2 new columns:

    quadrant        The quadrant to which the observation belongs to:
                    LL = low clusters = low values surrounded by low values
                    HH = high clusters = high values surrounded by high values
                    LH = low outliers = low values surrounded by high values
                    HL = high outliers = high values surrounded by low values
    significant     Whether the quadrant information is statistically
                    significant. The significance will depend on the number of
                    iterations and the random seed used in the process, as
                    polygons at the edge of significance may get slightly
                    different values at different runs.
